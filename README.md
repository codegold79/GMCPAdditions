Supported messages by modules
=============================

Core
----

### Sent by client ###

#### Core.Hello ####

- needs to be the first message that the client sends, used to identify the client
- message body is an object with keys "client" and "version", containing the client's name and version
- example: `Core.Hello { "client": "Nexus", "version": "3.1.90" }`

#### Core.Supports.Set ####

- notifies the server about packages supported by the client
- if another Core.Supports.* package has been received earlier, the list is deleted and replaced with the new one
- message body is an array of strings, each consisting of the module name and version, separated by space
- module version is a positive non-zero integer
- most client implementations will only need to send Set once and won't need Add/Remove; exceptions are module implementations provided by plug-ins
- example: `Core.Supports.Set [ "Char 1", "Char.Skills 1", "Char.Items 1" ]`

#### Core.Supports.Add ####

- similar to Set, but appends the supported module list to the one sent earlier
- if no list was sent yet, the behaviour is identical to Set
- if the list includes module names that were already included earlier, the new version number takes precedence over the previously sent one, even if the newly sent number is lower
- message body format is identical to that of Set

#### Core.Supports.Remove #####

- removes specified modules from the list of supported modules
- message body format is similar to Set, except that module version numbers are optional and ignored if given
- example: `Core.Supports.Remove [ "Char", "Char.Skills", "Char.Items" ]`

#### Core.KeepAlive ####

- causes the server to reset the timeout for the logged character, no message body

#### Core.Ping ####

- causes the server to send a Core.Ping back
- message body is a number which indicates average ping time from previous requests, if available
- example: `Core.Ping 120`

### Sent by server ###

#### Core.Ping ####

- Sent in reply to Core.Ping. No body.

#### Core.Goodbye ####
  
- Sent by server immediately before terminating a connection
- Message body is a string to be shown to the user - it can explain the reason for the disconnect
- Example: `Core.Goodbye "Goodbye, adventurer"`



Char
----

- Basic character attributes such as health, mana, etc.
- Message body is an object containing several variables
- Additionally, each variable is included in a string, in the format name:cur/max
- Interpretation of the variables is game specific
- It is generally safe to assume that the values are numbers (even though encoded as strings)
- Example: `Char.Vitals { "hp": "4500", "maxhp": "4800", "mp": "1200", "maxmp": "2500", "ep": "15000", "maxep": "16000", "wp": "14000", "maxwp": "15000", "nl": "10", "string": "H:4500/4800 M:1200/2500 E:15000/16000 W:14000/15000 NL:10/100" }`
#### Char.StatusVars ####

- sent by server after a successful login or after the module is enabled
- contains a list of character variables (level, race, etc)
- message body is an object
- each object element is a name-caption pair, name is the internal name and caption the user-visible one
- example: `Char.StatusVars { "level": "Level", "race": "Race", "guild": "Guild" }`

#### Char.Status ####
  
- values of character values defined by StatusVars
- a full list is sent by server right after StatusVars, and changes are sent in subsequent messages as they occur
- with the exception of the initial Status message, messages only contain changed values; if a variable is not included, it has not changed since the previous Status message
- message body is an object
- each object element is a name-value pair, name is the internal name defined by the StatusVars message and value is the variable value
